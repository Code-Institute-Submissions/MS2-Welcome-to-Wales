# MS2-Welcome-to-Wales
 Milestone Project #2 - a travel site for visiting Wales
![mockup_image]()
## An Overview
For my second milestone project I have chosen to build a travel site for things to do in Wales. This project is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and accompanying frameworks. Show casing mobile first design, useage of API's and a deeper dive into my current front end development knowledge with more confident use of HTML and CSS but also Javascript.

I decided on building a sit for visiting Wales because I wanted an easy to view experience for anyone who's deciding on their next getaway.
This site is simplistic to use and has a good flow between different sections which tie into eachother.

## UX
### The Experience:
I wanted to create a site where it's user friendly in deisgn and allows the user to flow explore the site easily and in a way that makes sence in terms of it's flow but to also have the most relelvant information that's needed for a travel site. 
Such as the local weather, things to do in the area and also a bit of history to provide a site that's to everyone's tastes. Or map markers holding information about it's marked place to provide more detail. I've made sure each button is working accordinly as well as having a site that's accessible to all and meets the speed requirements a user expects on a modern site (more on speed and accessibility in the testing section).

 

### Journey of the Site:

### Colours:
For the colours of the site I based the colour scheme off the colours of the Welsh flag. I primairly used the red from the flad as accent colours to add emphasis on buttons, full stops and exclamation marks to draw the user's attention to those areas even when someone is scrolling throgh the website with no particular aim.

## Wireframe:
For my wireframes, I used Balsamiq Wireframes to mockup and create the site in different device sizes. Shown below are the different wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. I started with the mobile site and worked from there to scale up the design. You can click on the image for a larger size.

<img src="" alt="Wireframes of all small, medium and large screen sizes" width="576" height="360" />

## Accessibility
The site was built with accessibility needs in mind. 
   * All images have the correct alt tags
   * Colours throughout the site offer contrast from on another to ensure easier readability
   * Tested with Lighthouse to improve and fix accessibility concerns

### Chrome developer tools
When building the site, during each section I used Chrome's inspect and developer tools (such as lighthouse) to validate my work and to ensure the site worked accross multiple screen sizes.
This was also used to debug any structual and/or styling issues ont he fly

### Buttons and Links
All buttons, links and audio that has been embedded has been accounted for and directs to the right source
