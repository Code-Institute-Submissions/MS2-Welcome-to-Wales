## Wireframe:
For my wireframes, I used Balsamiq Wireframes to mockup and create the site in different device sizes. Shown below are the different wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. I started with the mobile site and worked from there to scale up the design. You can click on the image for a larger size.

<img src="" alt="Wireframes of all small, medium and large screen sizes" width="576" height="360" />

## Accessibility
The site was built with accessibility needs in mind. 
   * All images have the correct alt tags
   * Colours throughout the site offer contrast from on another to ensure easier readability
   * Tested with Lighthouse to improve and fix accessibility concerns

### Chrome developer tools
When building the site, during each section I used Chrome's inspect and developer tools (such as lighthouse) to validate my work and to ensure the site worked accross multiple screen sizes.
This was also used to debug any structual and/or styling issues ont he fly
