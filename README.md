# MS2-Welcome-to-Wales
 Milestone Project #2 - a travel site for visiting Wales
![mockup_image]()
## An Overview
For my second milestone project I have chosen to build a travel site for things to do in Wales. This project is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and accompanying frameworks. Show casing mobile first design, useage of API's and a deeper dive into my current front end development knowledge with more confident use of HTML and CSS but also Javascript.
I decided on building a sit for visiting Wales because I wanted an easy to view experience for anyone who's deciding on their next getaway.
This site is simplistic to use and has a good flow between different sections which tie into eachother.

In this document I will go through what I've built and why, as well as future goals and testing that's been done to make sure this site is functional in what it offers as well as across multiple device types, from mobile to desktop.

## UX
### The Experience:
I wanted to create a site where it's user friendly in deisgn and allows the user to flow explore the site easily and in a way that makes sence in terms of it's flow but to also have the most relelvant information that's needed for a travel site. 
Such as the local weather, things to do in the area and also a bit of history to provide a site that's to everyone's tastes. Or map markers holding information about it's marked place to provide more detail. I've made sure each button is working accordinly as well as having a site that's accessible to all and meets the speed requirements a user expects on a modern site (more on speed and accessibility in the testing section).

### Journey of the Site:
The site starts off with a full page image of the coast lines of North Wales with a title and short description on the what the site will offer. This gives the user a clear understanding on what the site offers. Meaning that without any further interaction they will know that it is a website to showcase some quick details on Wales.

   * From hero image on at the top, the user can either scroll with their mouse or finger to the enxt section of the site or they can click the down arrow which guides the user down as well.

   * The user is then greated with a short paragraph about Wales, giving a quick description about Wales and it's location (more on why this matters in "site owner goals" ).
   
   * Following the welcome paragraph, the user is shown the current weather in Cardiff - the capital of Wales. This is done with the Dark Sky API with some JS to inject the information onto the document. Showing an animated image of the weather for a quick and clear idea, as well as the actual temperture and a written description of the weather. E.G. Overcast.

   * After the weather section, the user is greated with the information cards section where it starts off with 2 cards about Wales. This is sorted with Bootstrap's `col` class where the cards in mobile view are sorted by `col-12` so on smaller screen devices they are listed one on top of eachother to make sure information is not cramped next to each other and is easier to view. On  medium / large screen devices, this changes to `col-sm-6` to utlise screen that have a larger area.

   * Onto the final main section of the site which is the maps section where users can select differnt activities and see where in Wales they are without having to leave the site. This is intergrated with the Leaflet API along with JS to make the buttons functional. For example, in the maps section there is a castle button which when the user toggles the button (using the jquery command `$(btnName).click(function(task){})`), it places map markers to show where the top castles are in Wales.

   * The site itself features both a nav bar and a footer as well. With the navbar, I have placed it under the main hero image, meaning that it is not visable until the user scrolls down from the top. Once they have scrolled down they are then greated with the navbar which is `sticky-top` meaning that it's at the top of the screen when ever the user is going between differnt sections, but not when they go back to the hero image.
   The footer shows the important navigation functions for the site for users to quickly go back to certain sections like the weather section and the activity cards section.

   * A feature that is on the site is a back to top button that appears when the user scrolls down from the top of the site, allowing the user to quickly go back to top if they wanted to.


### Colours:
For the colours of the site I based the colour scheme off the colours of the Welsh flag. I primairly used the red from the flad as accent colours to add emphasis on buttons, full stops and exclamation marks to draw the user's attention to those areas even when someone is scrolling throgh the website with no particular aim.
Another reason for choosing `#D50130` as the primary accent colour is also because it's a good contrast over most other colours, meaning that on an accessibility stand point, it'll be easier to identify over the "lighter" colours on the rest of the site.

## UI 
### The Interface:
The site is built to be modern and mobile first. It's features are also supported across multiple browsers. This is shown in differnt parts of the site:
   
   * The hero image is designed to scale on differnt screen sizes but still taking up the equal amount of the screen to make it feel like it's a "landing page", so weather the user arrives to the site on a mobile device or a desktop device with a larger screen, it will seem more like a app (or web app) compared to other travel sites.

   * The navbar is then visable once the user scrolls down from the hero image, and is built to be stuck to the top with `sticky-top` from bootstrap's libary. Allowing users to always have the core navigation features to be present. The navbar is deisgned to be semi translucent to create a layering effect, so when users scroll down the page will experience the page "dissapear" behind the nav-bar, which is a deisgn feature present in some modern software. I chose to do this to offer a differnt feeling but to also algin with newer software design present in modern smart devices and computers.

   


## Objectives
### For the Site Owner:
* 
   

### For the User:
* 

## Wireframe:
For my wireframes, I used Balsamiq Wireframes to mockup and create the site in different device sizes. Shown below are the different wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. I started with the mobile site and worked from there to scale up the design. You can click on the image for a larger size.

<img src="" alt="Wireframes of all small, medium and large screen sizes" width="576" height="360" />

## Accessibility
The site was built with accessibility needs in mind. 
   * All images have the correct alt tags
   * Colours throughout the site offer contrast from on another to ensure easier readability
   * Tested with Lighthouse to improve and fix accessibility concerns

### Chrome developer tools
When building the site, during each section I used Chrome's inspect and developer tools (such as lighthouse) to validate my work and to ensure the site worked accross multiple screen sizes.
This was also used to debug any structual and/or styling issues ont he fly

### Buttons and Links
All buttons, links and audio that has been embedded has been accounted for and directs to the right source
